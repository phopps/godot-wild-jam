# Mauve: Prime Directive

*A robot is the sole survivor of a crash on an unknown planet.*

Mauve is an isometric tile-based adventure game where you play a M.A.U.V.E, a Magnetized Autonomous Utility Vehicle Explorer. Search rubble piles to regain lost parts of your chassis. Each new part lets you see more of the world around and in different ways - allowing you to see farther, perceive color, tempature and more. Drive over rubble piles to gain new parts, and drive over charge stations to recharge your rover.

Controls: W - Move Forward, S - Move back, A - Turn Left, D - Turn Right.
